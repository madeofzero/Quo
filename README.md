# O – Feedback, Simplified

**O** is a feedback tool built in public by [madeofzero](https://to.madeofzero.com/with-zero). It’s designed for teams who want to streamline feedback without adding another bloated admin portal or tracking system. This tool is for direct, easy, actionable feedback loops. Built with simplicity, transparency, and speed in mind.

## **Why We're Building O**  

We’re not building **O** because the world needs another feedback management tool. We’re building it because we’re frustrated with the current landscape. Here’s why:

1. **No More Admin Portals**: We're tired of feedback tools that turn into complex admin dashboards for organizing and tracking every minor detail. We need a tool that lets teams focus on the work—not on managing feedback.

2. **Simplicity First**: Feedback should be fast, simple, and useful. That’s why **O** is designed to be easy to use, open-source, and self-hosted. It’s free to use, and it’s built to get remote feedback into your hands in less than 1 second.

3. **Built for the Team**: We’re not just building this for product managers or designers. **O** is built for the engineers, developers, and creators who are doing the work, but also for stakeholders who need to give quick, actionable feedback. Once the devs are done with their work, they just connect **O** and send a URL to stakeholders. No more Loom videos, Figma docs, or long email chains—just direct feedback, fast.

## **How O Aligns with madeofzero**  

We are a studio that thrives on simplicity, transparency, and efficiency. **O** reflects these values directly:

- **No Waste, Just Focus**: Like all the work we do, **O** cuts through the fluff and focuses on what really matters—getting fast, actionable feedback and reducing friction in the process.  
- **Built for Real Work**: We're not making a tool to manage feedback for the sake of managing feedback. We’re making a tool that helps engineering teams work faster and smarter with clear, direct input from stakeholders.  
- **Transparency and Iteration**: We believe in getting feedback, acting on it, and iterating quickly. **O** supports that philosophy by making feedback collection and iteration fast and transparent.

## **We're Still WIP**

**O** is a work in progress. We’re still figuring out the final product, and things might change along the way. If you're curious about the current design and direction of the project, feel free to [check out our Figma doc](https://to.madeofzero.com/meet-0).

This doc contains the current wireframes, design ideas, and feature roadmap. We’ll keep it updated as we make progress, so feel free to take a look and give us feedback. Stay tuned for more changes!
